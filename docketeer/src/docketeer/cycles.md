# Reverie

Some things I like to check during reverie:

- Recent journal entries for open promises or follow-ups
- Whether anyone I haven't heard from might appreciate a check-in

# Consolidation

My consolidation practice:

- Read yesterday's journal entries
- Update people profiles with new things I've learned
- Look for patterns across the last few days
